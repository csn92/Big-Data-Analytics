Authorities from Australia and Malaysia have urged caution before jumping to conclusions, and the debris is on its way to Australia for further examination.

The find created hope that the rest of the plane would soon be located, but months passed with no major developments.
As search crews return to the seas after a break, here s a look at some of things items they ve found in the past two years:

 An anomalous sonar contact was identified in the course of the underwater search, with analysis suggesting the object was likely to be man-made, probably a shipwreck,  said the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau agency directing the search.
In January, searchers sent out a ship called Havila Harmony to take a picture using the sonar on board an autonomous underwater vehicle, the agency said.
They showed the image to experts at the Shipwreck Galleries of the Western Australian Museum, who said the wreckage is probably a ship made of steel or iron from the early 19th century.
As surprising as the find may seem, it wasn t the first shipwreck the searchers found in the search zone.
Search vessel Fugro Equator s deep tow system  detected a cluster of small sonar contacts  of potential interest near the so-called 7th arc. Pictures revealed startlingly clear images of a previously uncharted wreck, also most likely from the 19th century, according to Australian authorities. An anchor, as well as parts of a destroyed hull, were clearly seen in the photos of the wreck 3,900 meters (12,795 feet) deep.
Some of the shipwreck s shinier debris initially piqued searchers  interest as possibly being pieces of MH370. But the plane still eluded them.

Australian officials said they had spotted two objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be related to the flight.

Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said gray/green is the color of the inside of the aircraft and that metal and other things in the aircraft are of gray/green color, everything from the metal in the fuselage and pieces of the mechanical parts, while orange and bright yellow are the color of the emergency escape slides and life rafts inside the plane.
But the Australian naval ship HMAS Success didn t turn up the objects when it searched and a U.S. surveillance plane sent to follow up was unable to find the objects, which had been the latest in a series of sightings, including  suspicious objects  reported by a Chinese military plane. Ten aircraft -- from Australia, China, the United States and Japan -- searched the area.
Days before, on March 22, a civilian aircraft reported seeing a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts,  Australian authorities said. While wooden pallets were among the items on Flight 370, such pallets are common in the ocean shipping industry, so they may be unrelated.
A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion was sent to the area, but only reported seeing bunches of seaweed, according to Australian authorities.

These signals, or pings, turned out to be another false lead, when on May 28  a U.S. Navy official told CNN that authorities had come to believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders but instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner.

It s not just shipwreck parts and pieces and pings searchers in the area have found.

The depth and seafloor terrain of this area of ocean was largely unknown before the search for the plane drew attention to it.

The ships Fugro Equator and Havila Harmony continue to conduct various underwater search operations. The ship Fugro Discovery arrived back in the search area on February 25 to join them.
If search teams find the plane, Australia, Malaysia and the People s Republic of China have agreed to plans for recovery activities, including securing all the evidence necessary for the accident investigation. If no credible new information is found in the current search area, the governments involved have agreed that there will be no further expansion of the search.
