 The elevator had stopped between the 10th and 11th floors, so workers yelled from the 11th floor to see if anyone was inside. They did not hear an answer, and then cut off the power supply.
When they returned on March 1 to fix it -- after the Lunar New Year holiday -- they discovered the body, according to state media.
The woman, who lived in the building, may have died more than 30 days ago.
Local authorities arrested and charged the building s management and the elevator maintenance company. 
An autopsy ruled out the possibility of homicide.
