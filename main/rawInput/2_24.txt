 Emirates will be using flexible routes, which can vary by day, taking advantage of tail winds and avoiding head winds to reduce the time in the air,  it said.
Scheduled daily, the new flight shaves three hours from Emirates  existing services that include a stopover in Australia.
A double-decker A380 was used to celebrate the debut but the Boeing 777-200LR will fly the route regularly.
To help you get through those uninterrupted, layover-free hours, Emirates assures that  gourmet meals and fine wines  will be on offer, along with  more than 2,000 channels of entertainment and information  on individual screens.
