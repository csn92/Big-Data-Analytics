Turabi -- who was fluent in Arabic, English, French and German -- returned to Sudan, at one point becoming the University of Khartoum s law dean.
He soon established himself in Sudanese politics as well, including a stint as justice minister. He also developed a reputation as a leading Islamist, as illustrated by his founding of the National Islamic Front.

Bin Laden  agreed to help Turabi in an ongoing war against African Christian separatists in southern Sudan and also to do some road building,  the 9/11 report said.  Turabi in return would let [bin Laden] use Sudan as a base for worldwide business operations and for preparations for jihad. 
And this bargain held, picking up steam especially after bin Laden himself made Sudan his home in 1991. The 9/11 report noted that the terror leader, who was a trained civil engineer, helped build a highway from Khartoum to the Red Sea, while al Qaeda officials (via bin Laden s businesses) amassed  weapons, explosives and technical equipment for terrorist purposes. 
Meanwhile, Turabi continued to exert himself as an Islamist leader who perhaps inspired bin Laden to rally Muslims together.
 Turabi sought to persuade Shiites and Sunnis to put aside their divisions and join against the common enemy,  the 9/11 report said, noting Sudan s part in supporting al Qaeda and Iranian operatives   training for actions carried out primarily against Israel and the United States.

He retained influence, too, with bin Laden as when he reportedly brokered a deal so al Qaeda wouldn t back insurgents against then-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
By the mid-1990s, Western and other governments ramped up pressure on Bashir not to harbor al Qaeda anymore. in 1996, Sudanese officials expelled bin Laden, who moved with his family to then Taliban-run Afghanistan.
Turabi was pushed out, too, from Bashir s circle. Yet he maintained influence by founding the opposition Popular Congress Party and, in 1996, becoming speaker of Sudan s legislature.
He lasted in that role until 1999, when he proposed laws limiting a president s powers. Bashir responded by dissolving the assembly.
That put Turabi out of the speaker s job, but not out of the political picture.
